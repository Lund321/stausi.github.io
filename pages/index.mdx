# Introduction

Here you can find all of the official documentation for resources developed by the Overextended team.

If you feel like the documentation is lacking in some department then feel free to go onto that page and click the "Edit this page" at the bottom and submit a Pull Request.

## Support our team

We enjoy being able to create and share _free and open-source_ work, but they often require considerable time and effort to maintain and support.

If you frequently use our resources and love what we do, consider supporting us so we can continue our work.

## Creator codes

Creator codes allow Tebex stores to share a percentage of a purchase with us, while giving a discount to the customer. We make these deals to advertise trusted creators who meet our criteria.

- Resources are highly configurable or, preferably, source-available.
- We trust that customers will be given assistance.
- The creator is a known member of our community.

More information about these creators is available in our [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/813030955598086174/1028912864389496903).
